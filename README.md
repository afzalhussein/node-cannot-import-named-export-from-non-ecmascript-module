The error you're encountering with the `date-fns` library likely occurs when you're trying to import a named export, such as `differenceInHours`, from a file that isn't compatible with the ES module syntax.

The `date-fns` library provides both ES module (`.mjs`) and CommonJS (`.js`) versions. To resolve this issue, you can try importing the `differenceInHours` function from the CommonJS version of the library instead of the ES module version.

Here's an example of importing `differenceInHours` from the CommonJS version:

```javascript
// Importing using CommonJS syntax (require)
const { differenceInHours } = require('date-fns');

// Now you can use differenceInHours function
const startDate = new Date('2023-12-01');
const endDate = new Date('2023-12-02');
const hoursDifference = differenceInHours(endDate, startDate);

console.log('Difference in hours:', hoursDifference);
```

Make sure you are using the correct import syntax according to your project setup. If you're using ES modules (`.mjs` files) throughout your project, you might need to find an alternative way to import the `differenceInHours` function compatible with ES modules. 

Alternatively, you can check for an updated version of the `date-fns` library that provides proper ES module support or consider using other functions or methods available within the ES module-compatible version of `date-fns`.
